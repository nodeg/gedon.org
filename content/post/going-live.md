The blog is live! It is powered by the static page generator [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) and the ~~[Hemingway2](https://gitlab.com/beli3ver/hemingway2) [After Dark](https://git.habd.as/comfusion/after-dark)~~ [Hermit](https://github.com/Track3/hermit) theme.
Maybe I edit this post to add some instructions on how to set up and use Hugo (on uberspace 7).
